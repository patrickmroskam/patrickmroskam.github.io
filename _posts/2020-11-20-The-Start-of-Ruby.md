.5 hours <br />

Kicked off ruby on rails today. Was into it before but need to refresh for an upcoming project. Actually a couple projects I want to use it for. So far so good. I am working through [codecademy.com](http://ssqt.co/mQgjL6y) from the begining again. I want to start blocking off a couple hours a day to work through learning new things.
